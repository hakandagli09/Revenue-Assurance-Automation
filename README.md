Revenue Assurance Automation for Sevilla Sol Viajes

This project delivers an automated revenue-assurance system that reconciles more than 160,000 annual ERP sales orders with multi-provider commission reports. It replaces a highly manual, error-prone process with a reliable Python-based pipeline that produces clean, audit-ready datasets and a Tableau dashboard for leadership insights.

What This System Does
	•	Cleans and normalizes ERP sales orders (confirmation numbers, tax logic, provider fields)
	•	Cleans and aggregates vendor commission files (duplicates, inconsistent formats, missing locators)
	•	Reconciles expected vs billed commissions using a configurable matching engine
	•	Flags:
	•	Missing commissions
	•	Commissions with no corresponding order
	•	Over- or under-billed providers
	•	Provider-level trends and anomalies
	•	Generates a complete Excel report with KPIs, summaries, and discrepancy categories
	•	Powers an interactive Tableau dashboard for Finance & Accounting

Why It Matters

Revenue leakage in travel agencies can accumulate quietly across thousands of bookings.
This pipeline gives the organization:
	•	Transparency into provider performance
	•	Early detection of mismatches and billing errors
	•	Confidence that reported commissions match contractual expectations
	•	Efficiency by eliminating hours of manual Excel reconciliation
	•	Better decision-making through reliable data and automated analytics
